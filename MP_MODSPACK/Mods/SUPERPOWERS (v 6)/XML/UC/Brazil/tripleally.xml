				The Bandeirantes ("those who are of the banner") were 17th century Portuguese settlers in Brazil, fortune hunters and adventurers from the São Paulo region. They were the leaders of expeditions called "bandeiras" that penetrated the interior of Brazil far south and west of the Tordesillas Line of 1494 that divided the Spanish (west) domain from the Portuguese (east) domain in South America.  Though their original purpose was to capture and force Indigenous Americans into slavery, the bandeirantes later began to focus their expeditions on finding gold, silver, and diamond mines. As they ventured into unmapped regions in search of profit and adventure, they expanded the effective borders of Brazil.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Bandeiras were not state organized – they were privately run, and hence the men paid for their own equipment, and willingly and knowingly traversed into the wilderness for months or years at a time. The course of the bandeira route was a difficult and perilous one. The men were faced with hunger, fatigue, disease and death. Often there was little food.
