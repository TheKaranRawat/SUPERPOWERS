				In time the demands of the masses were heard and most states adopted, even if only nominally, a legislative body. In democracies, these legislative bodies became the political centres of the nation - one of three branches of Government. However, they were adopted by many authoritarian states where they only served to rubber stamp the decisions of the real power players - the dominant party or elite.
