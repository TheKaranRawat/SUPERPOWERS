				The Tower of Babel (/ˈbæbəl/ or /ˈbeɪbəl/; Hebrew: מִגְדַּל בָּבֶל‎, Migdal Bāḇēl) is an etiological myth in the Book of Genesis of the Tanakh (also referred to as the Hebrew Bible or the Old Testament) meant to explain the origin of different languages. According to the story, a united humanity of the generations following the Great Flood, speaking a single language and migrating from the east, came to the land of Shinar (Hebrew: שנער‎). There they agreed to build a city and tower; seeing this, God confounded their speech so that they could no longer understand each other and scattered them around the world.

				The Shoshone are a Native American tribe, who originated in the western Great Basin and spread north and east into Idaho and Wyoming. By 1500 CE some Eastern Shoshone had crossed the Rocky Mountains into the Great Plains. After 1750, warfare and pressure from the Blackfoot, Crow, Lakota, Cheyenne, and Arapaho pushed Eastern Shoshone south and westward. Some of them moved as far south as Texas, to become the Comanche by 1700.

				A sawmill is a facility where logs are cut into lumber (American English) or timber (British English). A sawmill's basic operation is much like those of hundreds of years ago; a log enters on one end and dimensional lumber exits on the other end. In the twentieth century the introduction of electricity and high technology furthered this process, and now most sawmills are massive and expensive facilities in which most aspects of the work is computerized. The cost of a new facility with 2 mmfbm/day capacity is up to CAN$120,000,000. A modern operation will produce between 100 mmfbm and 700 mmfbm annually.

				The Feitoria - Portuguese for "factory" - were trading posts established in foreign territories during the Middle Ages. A feitoria served simultaneously as marketplace, warehouse, settlement, and staging point for exploration. Often established with a grant from the Portuguese crown, these private enterprises repaid their debt through the buying and selling of goods on behalf of the crown and through collecting taxes on trade that passed through their gates. During the 15th and 16th centuries, a chain of over 50 feitoria were built along the coasts of west and east Africa, India, Malaya, China and Japan. The feitoria allowed Portugal to dominate the Atlantic and Indian Ocean trade routes for three centuries.

Joseph Haydn, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, Ludwig van Beethoven, Franz Schubert and Johann Strauss II, among others, were associated with the city, with Schubert being born in Vienna. During the Baroque period, Slavic and Hungarian folk forms influenced Austrian music.

				A dock (from Dutch dok) is either the area of water between or next to a human-made structure or group of structures involved in the handling of boats or ships, usually on or close to a shore, or the structures themselves. The exact meaning varies among different variants of the English language. "Dock" may also refer to a dockyard or shipyard where the loading, unloading, building, or repairing of ships occurs.

				Shipyards and dockyards are places where ships are repaired and built. These can be yachts, military vessels, cruise liners or other cargo or passenger ships. Dockyards are sometimes more associated with maintenance and basing activities than shipyards, which are sometimes associated more with initial construction. The terms are routinely used interchangeably, in part because the evolution of dockyards and shipyards has often caused them to change or merge roles.

Although previous castles usually had a defensible structure for residence and/or administration, the architecturally distinct tenshu was first constructed during the late Sengoku period, or Azuchi–Momoyama period (1573–1603). Azuchi Castle, built in 1576 by Oda Nobunaga, was Japan's first castle to have a tenshu.

Destroyed by a series of earthquakes that struck the region during the 1st millennium AD, portions of the tomb were excavated by British archaeologists in the mid 19th century.

The citadel was to serve as the main defensive point in the wall. In order to supply the Citadel with water, and provide a source in the event of a siege, Saladin had the Well of Joseph constructed. The well is 85 metres (200 feet) deep, and has three hundred stairs leading to it in a spiral, hense the other name of Spiral Well. Water from this well was transported to the Citadel via a series of Aqueducts. Following the death of Suleiman and during the Mamluk dynasty, Al-Nasir Muhammed took control of the Citadel. This saw the Well of Joseph struggle with the ammount of water needed, so Al-Nasir commissioned a series of wells, fed by waterwheels on the Nile river and then moved through the citadels through Saladin's aqueducts. A series of mosques are also positioned in the Citadel, combining various sects of Islamic architecture, among which Ottoman and traditional Mamluk / Ayyubid. The Citadel also acted as the seat of Egypt's government, from the era of Saladin until the 19th century.  </Text>

Each held the title briefly, but the Empire State Building is the tallest, holding the title since 1930, when it was completed. It was surpassed by the construction of the World Trade Center towers, but is now the tallest again following the events of September 11, 2001. Upon construction of the 443 metre tall building, the top was originally hoped to be an Airship terminal for New York City, transporting passengers to the ground via two elevators. This, however, was deemed to risky due to updrafts caused by the size of the building. Along with the Chrysler Building, the Empire State Building is a prime example of Art Deco architecture which was prominent during the Depression years of 1929-1932, and continued into World War 2. [NEWLINE] The Empire State Building is one of the most iconic buildings on earth, and is a landmark of New York City.

It operated from 1919 to 1933. At that time the German term About this Bauhaus - literally "house of construction" - was understood as meaning "School of Building". The Bauhaus was first founded by Walter Gropius in Weimar. The school existed in three German cities: Weimar from 1919 to 1925, Dessau from 1925 to 1932 and Berlin from 1932 to 1933, under three different architect-directors: Walter Gropius from 1919 to 1928, Hannes Meyer from 1928 to 1930 and Ludwig Mies van der Rohe from 1930 until 1933, when the school was closed by its own leadership under pressure from the Nazi regime. The Nazi government claimed that it was a centre of communist intellectualism. Though the school was closed, the staff continued to spread its idealistic precepts as they left Germany and emigrated all over the world.</Text>

This pyramid would help answer Tokyo's increasing lack of space, although the project would only handle a small fraction of the population of the Greater Tokyo Area. </Text>

				Satellite Units are special late-game units in SuperPower Mod. Those units function as Wonders, which can offer their unique global effects. Some of them can only provide bonus for their launchers while others give bonus to all existing civilizations. They are very helpful to speed up your victory process, especially for a [COLOR_POSITIVE_TEXT]Science Victory[ENDCOLOR]. However you should be aware that some Satellite Units with global effects may also help your opponents to catch up with you.
				[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]You must finish The Apollo program to build Satellite Units. Satellite Units must be built in cities with a spaceship factory.
				[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Satellite Units are like Wonders. They are unique and only one of each kind can exist in the world. If one civilization successfully build out one Satellite Unit, all other civilizations are no longer able to build it.
				[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Satellite Units must be [COLOR_POSITIVE_TEXT]Launched[ENDCOLOR] to be functional. You can launch those Satellite Units simply by moving them to your [ICON_CAPITAL] Capital and press the [COLOR_POSITIVE_TEXT]"Launch Satellite"[ENDCOLOR] button in the unit command panel.

			<Text>The World Trade Center was a complex of buildings in New York City, that are currently being replaced with new structures after the original was destroyed. The original World Trade Center featured landmark twin towers, which opened on April 4, 1973, and were destroyed in the September 11th terrorist attacks of 2001, along with 7 World Trade Center. The other buildings in the complex were severely damaged by the collapse of the twin towers, and their ruins were eventually demolished. The original World Trade Center was thought of as a North American cultural icon, and at the time of their completion, the "Twin Towers", the original 1 World Trade Center (the North Tower), at 417 metres (1,368 ft), and 2 World Trade Center (the South Tower), were the tallest buildings in the world. The other buildings in the complex included the Marriott World Trade Center (3 WTC), 4 WTC, 5 WTC, 6 WTC, and 7 WTC. All of these buildings were built between 1975 and 1985, with a construction cost of $400 million. The complex was located in New York City's Financial District and contained 13.4 million square feet (1.24 million m2) of office space.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]On the morning of September 11, 2001, Al-Qaeda-affiliated hijackers flew two Boeing 767 jets into the complex, one into each tower, in a coordinated act of terrorism. After burning for 56 minutes, the South Tower collapsed, followed a half-hour later by the North Tower. The attacks on the World Trade Center killed 2,753 people. Falling debris from the towers, combined with fires that the debris initiated in several surrounding buildings, led to the partial or complete collapse of all the other buildings in the complex and caused catastrophic damage to ten other large structures in the surrounding area (including the World Financial Center). The process of cleaning up and recovery at the World Trade Center site took eight months.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Over the following years, plans were created for the reconstruction of the World Trade Center. The Lower Manhattan Development Corporation (LMDC), established in November 2001 to oversee the rebuilding process, organized competitions to select a site plan and memorial design. The first new building at the site was the 7 World Trade Center, which opened in May 2006. The memorial section of the National September 11 Memorial and Museum opened on September 11, 2011 and the museum is expected to open in spring 2014. Construction of the One World Trade Center, also named "Freedom Tower", is nearing completion and it is expected to open in 2014; the 4 World Trade Center opened on November 13, 2013; the 3 World Trade Center is under construction and expected to open in 2016; as of November 2013, according to an agreement made with Silverstein Properties Inc., the 2 World Trade Center will not be built to its full height until sufficient leasing is established to make the building financially viable; and 5 World Trade Center will be developed by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, but, as of February 2014, a schedule was not confirmed.</Text>

It consists of the dish, which is on the ground, and a large reciever suspended above the dish by three towers which vary in height due to ground elevation. Since its construction in 1963, the observatory has been used for a variety of different purposes. Originally designed to study Earth's Ionosphere (The layer of Earth's atmosphere above 85 kilometres where solar radiation still affects the atmosphere. Auroras form in this layer), the Arecibo Observatory has since made a variety of discoveries and been used for several research projects. In 1990, the telescope was used to discover the first ever known Exo-planets (Planets existing outside our own Solar System). It was also used to discover Neutron stars (stars that half half a million times more mass than Earth in an area equivalent to the size of Brooklyn, New York). It has also been used for countless other astronomical discoveries. In 1974, the Observatory sent a message of binary characters, consisting of the numbers 1 to 10, DNA makeup, the solar system and more information, towards a star cluster known as globular cluser M13, around 25,000 light years away, in the hope of contacting intelligent life. </Text>

Work began on the monument in 1848, but was soon halted due to a myriad of reasons, including financial difficulties, internal power struggles within the organisation behind the monument, and the Civil War. Issues around construction had existed long before this, with the monument having to move from its original location due to unstable ground and a proposed colonnade surrounding the obelisk cancelled before construction. The monument was eventually completed in 1885 and opened to the public soon after, averaging 55,000 visitors per month by 1888.

			<Text>Sometimes known as the Amber Fort, Amer Fort is a fortress found in the town of Amer, less than seven miles from Jaipur. Built on a hill by Raja Man Singh I, Amer Fort is a popular attraction for its artistic style and blending of Hindu and Rajput architecture. The fort overlooks the Maota Lake on a forested hill. During medieval India Amer was known as Dhundar and ruled by the Kachwahas, the fort itself was built in 1592 over the remnants of the earlier structure by Raja Man Singh I, a commander of Akbar the Great's army and a member of the Emperor's inner circle. His decendant, Jai Singh I expanded Amer Fort further. Beyond then Amer Fort continued the further improve with every ruler who followed for the next 150 years, until the Kachwahas shifted the capital to Jaipur during the reign of Sawai Jai Singh II in 1727.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Many of the original buildings of the medieval period have either been destroyed of replaced, the sixteenth century edifice however and the palace complex within build by the Rajput Maharajas is very well preserved. Amer Fort is split into four sections, each with its own gate and courtyard. The main entrance is the "Suraj Pole" - the Sun Gate - leading to the first courtyard. Armies held victory parades at the gate with their bounty. The gate was built for the purpose of protection, a garrison was posted to secure the main entry into the palace, and the gate itself faces east to greet the sun - where it takes its namesake. The first courtyard leads to the palace grounds and is resplendant with temples as well as the Ganesh Gate entering into the palaces. The second courtyard houses the Public Audience Hall; the Raja held audiences to heed petitions from the public. The Ganesh Gate opened into the third courtyard where the private quarters of the royal family and the servants were kept. This courtyard holds two buildings seperated but a garden fashioned similiarly to the Mughal Gardens. The two buildings are the "Jai Mandir", commonly known as the Sheesh Mahal - or Mirror Palace - and the "Sukh Niwas" or Sukh Mahal - the Hall of Pleasure. The Mirror Palace is known for its beautiful glass panels and mirror patterned ceilings. The fourth courtyard is where the royal family women resided, displaying a number of living rooms along a common corridor.</Text>

			<Text>The Agra Fort is a citadel found in the city of Agra. Just two and a half kilometers from the elegant Taj Mahal, the fort is first mentioned in 1080, where a Ghaznavide force took control of it. Sikandar Lodi was the first Sultan to stay in the fort as he shifted the capital of the Lodi Dynasty to Agra; in 1503 Sikandar commissioned the construction of much of modern-day Agra. The Mughals captured Agra and the fort in 1526, plundering the treasure inside - including the famous Koh-i-Noor Diamond. The Hindu king Hem Chandra Vikramaditya briefly captured Agra in 1553, but lost control three years after back to the Mughals under Akbar the Great. Under Akbar the fort underwent reconstruction in 1565, taking eight years to complete. Akbar's grandson, the famous Shah Jahan, would complete the fort during his reign to the current design.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The Agra Fort is a 94 acre walled city in a semicircular design. Within the 70 foot high walls contains halls, mosques, houses from guesses, a ladies bazaar, and the Grape Garden - a large garden featuring its 85 square geometeric design. Along the wall two of the fort's gates are most noteworthy; the "Delhi Gate" and the "Lahore Gate", commonly known as the Amar Singh Gate, named after the nobleman. The Delhi Gate is the greatest of the four gates and was the masterpiece of Akbar the Great, built in 1568. Designed to enhance both the security and the embellishemtn of the formal gate, it is furnished in while marble as the prevailing symbol of the power of the Mughals. The general design of the gates and walls were to ensure the fort impregnable; during siege elephants would crush the gates of a fort, the Agra Fort - having been built on a uneven slope - rendered this method ineffective.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The fort is very important in understanding the architectural history. Akbar's historian, Abul Fazal, recorded 500 buildings in Bengal and Gujarat design were built. Some of these were destroyed by Shah Jahan to make room for his own palaces, others from the British between 1803 and 1862. Today just 30 Mughal buildings stand in the south-eastern side of the fort, of these the Delhi and Akbar Gates and the Bengali Mahal palace remain as symbols of Akbar the Great.</Text>

			<Text>Informally known as the Golden Temple, Harmandir Sahib is a prominent Gurdwara - Sikh temple - in the city of Amritsar. Built by Guru Arjan Dev in 1604, the Guru completed the Adi Granth, the holy text of Sikhism, and placed it in the Gurdwara. Before the building of the Harmandir Sahib, the site was surronded by a lake and thin forest. Akbar the Great visited Guru Amar Das at the neighbouring town of Goindval and was so impressed at the way of life in the town he gave the land and the revenues of the nearby villages to the Guru's daugther as a marital gift. At the end of 1588 Arjan Dev began the construction of the temple by laying the foundation stone, the construction took just over fifteen years to complete. In the mid eighteenth century the Harmandir Sahib was attacked by Afghans; one of Ahmed Shah Addali's generals, Jahan Khan, and required substancial reconstruction in 1764.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The four doors of the Harmandir Sahib symbolize the openness of Sikhism towards all people and their religions. Inside the temple are many shrines of past Gurus and saints, as well as commemorative plaques and inscriptions on the Gurus, saints and fallen Sikh soldiers during World Wars I and II. Outside there are three bers, holy trees, signifying historical events or Sikh saints. Much of the gilding and marble dates back to the early ninteenth century, the gold and marble were placed under the patronage of Hukam Singh Chimni and Emperor Ranjit Singh, the Maharaja of the Sikh Empire, the gold plating itself completing at 1830.</Text>

			<Text>The Hawa Mahal is a palace in the city of Jaipur. Built in 1799 by Maharaja Sawai Pratap Singh, the architect Lal Chand Ustad designed the structure from the crown of the Hindu god Krishna. The design of the 953 windows, known as 'jharokhas', is also compared to that of the honeycomb of the beehive. The original idea for the latticework on the windows is to allow the royal ladies to view the streets below without themselves being seen, observing strict 'purdah', face coverage. Sawai Pratap Singh's grandfather, Sawai Jai Singh founded Jaipur in 1727. Sawai Pratap Singh comissioned the Hawa Mahal as an expansion of the Royal City Palace, and Pratap Singh was a devoted adherent to Khrishna, this contributed to the design of the building as the Mukuta, Khrishna's headgear.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Though no actual historical evidence is available, it is believed that the women of the royal family, having to observe purdah, were given the opportunity to witness the transactions of the markets and royal processions behind the stone carved screens. Hawa Mahal was also used by the royal family as a retreat from the hot weather of Jaipur, the unusually designed windows provided a cool breeze and ventilation. The five story Hawa Mahal rises 50 feet from the base with the top three floors having the dimention of just one room, the bottom two floors have patios at the back of the structure. The shape of the front facade of the building is designed from semi-octagonal bays, producing its unique face, whereas the back side of the building retains need-based chambers with pillars and corridors reaching to the top floor. Inside the Hawa Mahal is described as "having rooms of different coloured marbles, relieved by inlaid panels; while fountains adorn the center of the courtyard".[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Lal Chand Ustad also planned the founding of Jaipur, considered at the time as one of the best-planned cities in India. The red and pink sandstone of the Hawa Mahal reflects the other monuments and the epithet of Jaipur as the "Pink City". It is also a reflection of the fusion of Rajput and Mughal architecture; the use of the Rajput style using domed canopies and fluted pillars, and the Mughal style of stone inlay filigrees and arches.</Text>

			<Text>The Kandariya Mahaadeva Temple is the largest and most decorated medieval temple found in the Khajuraho Group of Monuments in India. It is one of the best examples of preserved temples from India's medieval era. One of India's most popular tourist attractions today, Khajuraho was the religious capital of the Chandela Rajputs. The temple was built by King Vidyadhara, arguably one of the greatest of the Chandela kings, at about 1050.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The main spire - the shikhara - rises 31 meters and forms the shape of Mount Kailash, the residence of lord Shiva; of whom the temple worships, and is surrounded by 84 smaller spires. The temple features columned halls, an entrance porch and the inner sanctum. 646 statues decorate the sides of the temple and at the top of the shikhara is the amalaka; a circular ring motif commonly found in the architecture of temples in northern India. Also, 226 figures are found lining parts of the temple's wall, but some of these are of a sexual nature and are not publicly displayed.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The name of the site means 'the Cave of Mahadeva', Mahadeva being another name for Shiva. The temple represents the pinnacle of traditional medieval nouth Indian temple architecture. At first glance the temple appears to be formed from a single piece of solid stone, when this is not the case.</Text>

			<Text>Both the Greeks and Romans created palisades to protect their military camps. The Roman historian Livy describes the Greek method as being inferior to that of the Romans during the Second Macedonian War. The Greek stakes were too large to be easily carried, and were spaced too far apart. This made it easy for enemies to uproot them and create a large enough gap in which to enter. In contrast, the Romans used smaller and easier to carry stakes which were placed closer together, making them more difficult to uproot.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]--Wikipedia</Text>

			<Text>Pottery originates during the Neolithic period. Ceramic objects like the Gravettian culture Venus of Dolní Věstonice figurine discovered in the Czech Republic date back to 29,000–25,000 BC, and pottery vessels discovered in Jiangxi, China date back to 20,000 BP. Early Neolithic pottery has also been found in Jomon Japan (10,500 BC), the Russian Far East (14,000 BC), Sub-Saharan Africa and South America.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Pottery is made by forming a clay body into objects of a required shape and heating them to high temperatures in a kiln which removes all the water from the clay, which induces reactions that lead to permanent changes including increasing their strength and hardening and setting their shape. A clay body can be decorated before or after firing. Prior to some shaping processes, clay must be prepared. Kneading helps to ensure an even moisture content throughout the body. Air trapped within the clay body needs to be removed. This is called de-airing and can be accomplished by a machine called a vacuum pug or manually by wedging. Wedging can also help produce an even moisture content. Once a clay body has been kneaded and de-aired or wedged, it is shaped by a variety of techniques. After shaping it is dried and then fired.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]--Wikipedia</Text>

			<Text>In the Old World, humans learned to smelt metals in prehistoric times, more than 8000 years ago. The discovery and use of the "useful" metals — copper and bronze at first, then iron a few millennia later — had an enormous impact on human society. The impact was so pervasive that scholars traditionally divide ancient history into Stone Age, Bronze Age, and Iron Age. In the Americas, pre-Inca civilizations of the central Andes in Peru had mastered the smelting of copper and silver at least six centuries before the first Europeans arrived in the 16th century.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]--Wikipedia</Text>

In closed ecological systems, waste products produced by one species must be used by at least one other species. In order to maintain human or animal life, waste products such as carbon dioxide, feces and urine must eventually be converted into oxygen, food and water. All closed ecological systems must contain at least one autotrophic organism. While both chemotrophic and phototrophic organisms are plausible, almost all closed ecological systems to date are based on a phototroph such as green algae.

Its historic bazaar complex is one of the most important commercial centres on the Silk Road. Located in the center of the city of Tabriz, Iran, this spectacular structure consists of several sub-bazaars.The bazaar was most prosperous during the 16th century when the town became the capital city of the Safavid kingdom. The city lost its status as a capital in the 17th century, but its bazaar has remained important as a commercial and economic center.The bazaar is also used for some important religious ceremonies. The most famous being Day of Ashura during which merchants cease trading for about 10 days and religious ceremonies are held inside the bazaar. Like other bazaars in Middle East, there are several mosques constructed behind the bazaar, the most notable of them being Jameh Mosque.  </Text>

			<Text>Buda Castle is a complex of fortifications and the residence to the Hungarian kings in Budapest. Castle Hill - site of Buda Castle - was first occupied in 1265 by King Béla IV. The oldest part of the complex is the foundations of Stephen's Tower, a caster keep built during the fourteenth century by Stephen, the Duke of Slovakia and younger brother to King Louis I of Hungary. King Sigismund strengthened its fortifications and enlarged the palace, from 1410 until after his death in 1437, as a bid to express primacy among Europe as the Holy Roman Emperor. Kings Matthias Corvinus, Vladislaus II and John Zápolya all continued the work of the expansion of the castle before the Ottomans conquered Budapest and the castle, and the subsequent sieges contributed to the medieval castle's ruin, especially during the Battle of Buda in 1686. Work on the castle was on and off for many years until in 1748 Count Antal Grassalkovich appealed to the public to complete the repairs of the castle. The Palatine János Pálffy appealed to the countries and city-states to award grants; the moment was most opportune as support for the Habsburgs were at its peak and Hungarians supported Maria Theresa in the War of Austrian Succession. The queen was appreciative and funded the work to reconstruct Buda Castle. Since then the castle has gone through many cycles of destruction and rebuilding right up to the end of World War II, where in 1948 the re-construction of the castle took on a modernist design. The current version of the castle was build in 1966 and the interior completed in the 1980s.</Text>

The structure stands beside Lake Titicaca, near the Bolivian city of La Paz. Ten feet tall and thirteen feet wide, the gate is a single stone block weighing an estimated ten tons. Rediscovered by Europeans in the mid-nineteenth century, the gate was found lying on the ground with a large crack across its face. Even though the gate now sits on the site of its discovery, it is not believed to be the site of its construction, which remains uncertain. [NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The gate is a wealth of knowledge of pre-Colombian art and architecture. The gate displays elements of Tiwanaku iconography known to be found throughout Peru and parts of Bolivia. Although there are differing theories of the inscriptions found, they are generally believed to possess astronomical, or perhaps astrological, significance and may have served a calendrical purpose.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE] Across the head of the gate are 48 squares surrounding a central figure. Each of these squares depict a winged effigy, 32 of which with human faces. All of these effigies look to the central figure, who also remains unknown. The figure is that of a man whose head is surrounded by rays which may represent the rays of the sun. The figure holds two stylized staffs which appear to represent thunder and lightning. Current theories about this character are that he may be the "Sun God", while other identify him as Viracocha, the Incan creator god - who is worshiped as a god of the sun and storms.</Text>

It was first observed during the 1960's, when archeologists noted that the hill could not be natural due to the shape, yet dismissed it as a Byzantine burial ground. It was not thought different until 1994, and not excavated until a year later. The complex is similar in manner to Stonehenge, with a round shape and large Monolithic stones.

			<Text>Horyu-ji is a Buddhist temple located in the Nara Prefecture of Japan. The name translates as Temple of the Flourishing Law, with Ji translating as Temple. The complex was completed in the year 607, at which time it was known as Ikaruga-dera. The temple was comissioned by Prince Shotoku, the palace complex of whom occupied the eastern portion of the grounds. It is widely believed that the current temple is a restoration, after the original temple was destroyed in 670 by what is believed to be fire. Horyu-ji possesses a unique style of architecture, combining elements of Han and Wei Chinese Kingdoms, the Three Kingdoms of Korea and traditional Japanese architecture. The original temple would have lacked this, and as such the restoration allowed for a unique combination of architecture styles seen through exploration of the Eastern Asia region that is extremely unusal, and only seen in other Asuka style buildings in the Nara Prefecture, yet Horyu-ji is unique even amongst these. Other Asuka style complexes feature layouts that are similar to Chinese and Korean counterparts as well as the architecture. Horyu-ji, however, as it is a restoration, is built on the footprints of the earlier temple, and as such shares the layout, which is a Japanese temple style.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE] Horyu-ji has several different iconic buildings, each with features unique to the temple. The Pagoda is one of the oldest wooden buildings on Earth. The central pillar is constructed from a tree dated to being felled in 594 CE. At the base of this pillar is said to be a fragment of a bone of Buddha. The five tiered style of the pagoda means that one is not allowed to climb up. Horyu-ji also features a Kondō, the wood of which dates to 670 CE. This has been suggested as being proof that the building was under construction at the time of the fire that destroyed so much of the rest of the complex. The complex also houses several pieces that are national Japanese treasures, including Buddhist treasures dating to the 7th Century, murals which combine artstyles of Japan and mainland Asia, and are similar to those found in the Ajanta Caves of India. There are also Kannon statuettes and other religious iconography. </Text>

It is often refered to as the 'Venice of the Pacific', after the fact that the city was built on the shoreline and out to sea and features a series of canals throughout the site. Local legends say that Nan Madol was constructed by Olisihpa and Olosohpa, twin sorcerers who wished to worship the god of Agriculture, Nahnisohn Sahpw, and constructed an altar at the future site of the city. This lead to the sacred nature of most of the city, and the reason for the location of its construction. Food and Water were brought in by boat for the Saudeleur populace, which allowed for the continuation of the city. When this was interrupted by the invading Nahnmwarkis, who subsequently occupied the city following 1628, they were unable to sustain the city and eventually abandoned it.</Text>

The construction took the entire 1930's to build, and during which time workers on the site did not have safety harnesses, and so were subject to narrow steel girders with a large fall below. It is here that Charles Ebbet's iconic photograph of eleven men eating lunch on a girder overlooking Manhattan was taken.

It was constructed under the orders of Mehmed II "The Conqueror", under whom the city was captured from the Byzantines and renamed Istanbul, as part of a scheme to re-build the city following the sucessful Ottoman siege. The palace served as the official residence of the Ottoman sultans for nearly four centuries of their rule, lasting until Sultan Abdul Mecid I moved the court to a newly-built palace further up the Bosphorous in 1856. Topkapi Palace is in fact more of a walled village than a palace, with several small buildings and many courtyards as opposed to one central structure. The site is home to many relics and artefacts collected both by the Sultans and following the end of the Ottoman empire when the palace was turned into a Museum. Among these are relics sacred to the Islamic world, including a door to the Great Mosque of Mecca, as well as what is said to be the cloak and sword of the prophet Muhammed. Other items include many collected from Silk Road trade, such as various pieces of Chinese porcelain from across four different dynasties of rule, and a collection of Islamic weaponry spanning approximately 13 centuries.

			<Text>The Golden Gate Bridge is a suspension bridge spanning the Golden Gate strait, the mile-wide, three-mile-long channel between San Francisco Bay and the Pacific Ocean, an area known as the Golden Gate. Completed in 1937, the structure links the U.S. city of San Francisco, on the northern tip of the San Francisco Peninsula, to Marin County, bridging both U.S. Route 101 and California State Route 1 across the strait. The bridge is one of the most internationally recognized symbols of San Francisco, California, and the United States. The Frommers travel guide considers the Golden Gate Bridge "possibly the most beautiful, certainly the most photographed, bridge in the world". Conceived, designed, and promoted by engineering student Joseph Strauss, it once had the longest suspension bridge main span in the world, at 4,200 feet, a title held by it until 1964.</Text>
