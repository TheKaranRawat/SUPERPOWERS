			<Text>The Tzompantli is the Aztec unique replacement for the Walls. In addition to increasing City [ICON_STRENGTH] defensive strength, the Tzompantli also yields [ICON_CULTURE] Culture and [ICON_PEACE] Faith. It is cheaper to construct and available one technology sooner than Walls.</Text>

			<Text>A tzompantli is a type of wooden rack or palisade documented in several Mesoamerican civilizations, which was used for the public display of human skulls, typically those of war captives or other sacrificial victims. It is a scaffold-like construction of poles on which heads and skulls were placed after holes had been made in them. The name comes from the Classical Nahuatl language of the Aztecs. Its precise etymology is uncertain, although its general interpretation is "skull rack", "wall of skulls", or "skull banner". Special walls, palisades, or platforms were decorated with skulls and had holes for mounting poles. Besides being sources of intimidation, it is acknowledged that in Mesoamerican culture to be sacrificed was to be honored with feeding the gods.</Text>
