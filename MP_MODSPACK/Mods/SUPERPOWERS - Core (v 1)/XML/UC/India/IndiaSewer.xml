			<Text>Like the standard Water Mill, the Indian Sewer improves the [ICON_FOOD] Food and [ICON_PRODUCTION] Production of cities. However, the Sewer increases [ICON_FOOD] Food even more, costs no maintenance, and has no technology prerequisite, allowing you to construct it before researching The Wheel.

			<Text>The ancient Indus systems of sewerage and drainage that were developed and used in cities throughout the Indus region were far more advanced than any found in contemporary urban sites in the Middle East and even more efficient than those in many areas of Pakistan and India today. Many houses had private wells and almost all houses had proper sanitation systems with the facility of sewage drains which connected through chutes to street drains. These street drains were aligned to the margin of the streets and equipped with manholes. Public wells could be found throughout the city as well as several baths. City walls served an additional function as a barrier against floods.</Text>
