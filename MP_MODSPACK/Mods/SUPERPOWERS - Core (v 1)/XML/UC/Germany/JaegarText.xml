		  <Text>Jaeger is a German military term adopted in 1631 by the landgrave of Hesse when he first formed an elite infantry unit out of his professional hunters (J채ger) and rangers (Forstleute) in the Hessian Army. During the Age of Enlightenment in German-speaking states (and others influenced by them) J채ger is used to describe elite light infantry, especially skirmishers, scouts, sharpshooters and couriers. J채ger, which means "hunter" or "huntsman" in German, came by extension to denote light infantrymen whose forester background made them suitable for skirmishing as individuals rather than as a drilled and regimented body of soldiers. Often they came from families with a tradition of service to one feudal lord. Initially J채gers made use of their own precision made rifles: a more accurate weapon with a longer range than the muskets used by line troops.</Text>
