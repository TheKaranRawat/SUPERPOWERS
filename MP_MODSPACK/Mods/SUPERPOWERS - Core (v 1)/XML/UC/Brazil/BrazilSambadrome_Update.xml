				<Text>The Sambradrome is the Brazilian unique building, replacing the Stadium. It increases the [ICON_HAPPINESS_1] Happiness of the city. It cannot provide more [ICON_HAPPINESS_1] Happiness than there are [ICON_CITIZEN] Citizens in a city. Unlike the Stadium it replaces, the Sambadrome boosts [ICON_TOURISM] Tourism in the city and has a Musician Specialist slot. City must already have a Zoo.</Text>
