Its origins can be traced back to the aviation pioneers around the turn of the century from the 19th century to the 20th although the work of Sir George Cayley has recently been dated as being from the last decade of the 18th century. Early knowledge of aeronautical engineering was largely empirical with some concepts and skills imported from other branches of engineering. Only a decade after the successful flights by the Wright brothers, the 1920s saw extensive development of aeronautical engineering through development of World War I military aircraft. Meanwhile, research to provide fundamental background science continued by combining theoretical physics with experiments. </Text>

While the original nanomaterial plants required very specific environments and raw materials to work with, more sophisticated nanoscale machines, while not true nanotechnology, helped make the process easier and less intensive. Raw materials such as coal or oil could be fed into specially-built converters, and the nanoscale machines would dutifully work to convert these into useful nanomaterials. Although there were concerns that these early nanomachines could potentially run amok, converting any organic material they found into nanomaterials, the relatively simple construction of these nanoscale machines meant they still need a protected environment to work, and were unlikely to survive long in the wild. Their programming and design was also still relatively limited, as they could only convert certain materials into others, and could not, for example, construct copies of themselves. Still, many more ecologically-minded societies considered converters a serious risk to the environment.</Text>

			<Text>With interconnected computer systems becoming increasingly prevalent in society, some researchers and engineers started to grow concerned about how much information traffic could actually be handled by existing networks. Increasingly sophisticated means to handle data transfers between remote systems were developed, and in some cities dedicated infrastructure was laid down to accomodate these. This new infrastructure would form a backbone for future information technologies and data networks, particularly with the advent of neural-direct interfaces, as they could permit enormous quantities of data to be transmitted clearly and without errors. They also made existing computer servers even more accessible to everyone, greatly increasing the dissemination of new ideas. However, they competed with the increasingly expansive feedsite networks, and many communities that had limited space and bandwidth had to decide which to prioritize.</Text>

However, in the event of large waves, strong elastic membranes would be attached to the lagoons around the outer circumference of the cells, with the shallows above the membranes standing 10m (32.8 ft) above sea level. The water pressure difference between the lagoons and the ocean would limit the movement of the membranes and buffer the force of the open sea waves. Additionally, 20-30m (66-98 ft) high seawalls would be constructed to handle a worst-case scenario.

				The Shimizu Mega-City Pyramid is a proposed project for construction of a massive pyramid over Tokyo Bay in Japan. The structure would be about 14 times higher than the Great Pyramid at Giza, and would house 1,000,000 people. The structure would be 2000 meters (6,561 feet) above mean sea level, including 5 stacked trusses, each with similar dimensions to that of the great pyramid of Giza. This pyramid would help answer Tokyo's increasing lack of space, although the project would only handle 1/47th of the Greater Tokyo Area's population. [NEWLINE] The proposed structure is so large that it cannot be built with currently available materials, due to their weight. The design relies on the future availability of super-strong lightweight materials based on carbon nanotubes.

It would have a main tower 1,228 metres (4,029 ft) high, with 300 stories housing approximately 100,000 people. The bionic tower would be exactly 400 meters taller than the current tallest building, Burj Khalifa. The point of the Bionic Tower is to use Bionics to solve the world's rising population problems in an eco-friendly way, an incredibly difficult feat to accomplish.
				[NEWLINE] The Bionic Tower is composed of two complexes put together. The first complex, Bionic Tower, is made up of twelve vertical neighborhoods, each eighty meters high. The neighborhoods are separated by safety areas to make for easier construction and evacuation in case of an emergency. Each neighborhood has two groups of buildings, one on the interior of the building and one on the exterior. Both groups of buildings are situated around large gardens and pools. The second complex, called the Base Island, is 1,000 meters in diameter, and is made up of many buildings, gardens, pools, and communication infrastructures. Foreseen uses of these complexes include hotels, offices, residential, commerce, cultural, sports, and leisure.

				Sky City 1000 is a visionary (i.e. not proposed/intended to be built) supertall skyscraper in the Tokyo metropolitan area, Japan announced in 1989 during the height of the Japanese asset price bubble. [NEWLINE]
				The plan consists of a building 1,000 metres (3,281 ft) tall and 400 m (1,312 ft) wide at the base, and a total floor area of 8 km2 (3.1 sq mi). The design, proposed in 1989 by Takenaka Corporation, would house between 35,000 and 36,000 full-time residents, as well as 100,000 workers. It comprises 14 concave dish-shaped "Space Plateaus" stacked one upon the other. The interior of the plateaus would contain greenspace, and on the edges, on the sides of the building, would be the apartments. Also included in the building would be offices, commercial facilities, schools, theatres, and other modern amenities

With a total height of 3,218.7 metres (10,560 ft), the tower would be 2 miles tall, and comprise 500 stories if built.[NEWLINE] The proposed tower would have a diameter at the base of 1,828.8 metres (6,000 ft), and comprise 1,500,000,000 square feet (140,000,000 m2) of interior floor space. Tsui proposed that the tower would be home to 1 million people, and would cost an estimated US$150 billion. The tower would use the atmospheric pressure difference between the bottom and the top of the tower to create electricity throughout the tower The building is intended to handle problems with overpopulation and to create a "mini-ecosystem" for its inhabitants.

The proposed development will be constructed on seven platforms totalling 400 hectares to be built in the River Plate. It will be connected to the rest of Buenos Aires by a 5 km long viaduct. The development, at an estimated cost of US $3.33 billion, is expected to be completed in 2016 and create 20,000 jobs. [NEWLINE]	In an interview with Momento24, the architect Julio Torcello spoke of the project's location and good financial situation. He said "Everything is ready for the construction". [NEWLINE] Depending on the status of several other similarly tall proposed skyscrapers, the tower could become the tallest tower in the world.

At a total height of 634 metres (A height chosen to represent the name Musashi, a former name for the area where the Skytree is located) the Tokyo Skytree is the tallest tower in the world, and is second only to Dubai's Burj Khalifa in total height of a man-made structure. Such a height was necissary in order for the function of the tower as a broadcasting tower to be possible. The previous version, Tokyo Tower, faced issues with its height and the height of surrounding Skyscrapers resulting in intermittent coverage.

The main feature of the Shanghai World Financial Center is the large rectangular apeture located near the top of the building. In early designs this was intended to be a circle, however controversy about similarities to the 'Rising Sun' motif of Japan lead to the shape being changed. </Text>

			<Text>As sources of raw materials, particularly petroleum and other organic compounds, became increasingly scarce in the 22nd century, new technologies were developed to help refine them. Converters were able to fill much of this need, but one of the most notable achievements was the construction of the Nessus Orbital Refinery. Located at the L4 Lagrange Point, it processed captured carbonaceous asteroids to produce various carbon-based nanomaterials. Much of its output was in turn used in orbital development, helping build new space stations and setting the stage for exploration of the solar system. Eventually, however, this same exploration and colonization of the solar system eclipsed the Nessus platform, as newer and more efficient facilities were constructed in the asteroid belt, avoiding the somewhat risky process of needing to deliver asteroids to Earth orbit. The Nessus Orbital Refinery was deactived in 2067, although it is still maintained as a relic of the early days of space colonization.</Text>

It made extensive use of artificial intelligence, with the Sentient Hyper-Optimized Data Analysis Network (or SHODAN) being the primary intelligence managing station operations. Unfortunately, the station was destroyed in 2072, although the exact circumstances are still unknown. The most likely culprit appears to be mechanical failure, as there were several malfunctions noticed shortly before its destruction, including jettisoned components. Other theories include sabotage, terrorism, or even outlandish theories suggesting an alien attack or an asteroid impact.</Text>

			<Text>Perhaps one of the most notable developments of genetic engineering towards the end of the 22nd century was the Pholus Mutagen. This mutagen appears to be highly adaptive, and works quickly to modify the entire ecology of its environment. While many of the effects are somewhat beneficial, with plants and animal life being stronger and more resilient, they also display rather hostile tendencies towards outsiders, which are often anyone who hasn't been similarly mutated. One unusual feature of the mutagen is the difficulty researchers have had in reverse-engineering it and modifying its effects -- efforts compounded by the adaptability and near-sapience of the entities affected by it. While most attribute these effects to accident, particularly due to the poor documentation of its design and release, there are some who attirbute the mutagen to an extraterrestrial origin. Others suggest it was the product of an artificial intelligence that has since vanished or been deleted. Oddly, both camps point towards the destruction of Citadel Station at approximately the same time as evidence to support their theories, although most dismiss this as mere coincidence.</Text>

While subject to a significant amount of criticism from those opposed to artificial intelligence, or who feel that creative pursuits cannot be performed by computers, virtual idols have developed an increasingly widespread following as their performances become increasingly diverse and unique in style. The earliest virtual idol of note was Hatsune Miku, a humanoid persona using a synthesizer program created by Crypton Future Media. Much of her popularity stemmed from the growing network culture of the time, although she also helped pioneer methods of putting on live performances with sythesized personas. These advances helped pave the way for other virtual idols who followed, such as Maria and Sharon Apple.</Text>

However, by creating a widespread network of utility fogs and controlling them via a highly intelligent AI (or several networked together), it is possible to create an angelnet -- an all-pervasive supervision and safety infrastructure. While an angelnet can provide many of the same benefits as utility fog, such as allowing the easy construction of buildings and furniture on demand, its most notable benefits are the safety and security it confers.

			<Text>The advent of artificial intelligence has long been fraught with controversy -- even from its earliest stages, there were many who proposed that a machine intelligence should never be equated to that of a human, and that if intelligent machines were ever to become possible, said machines should be modified so that it wasn't. While the continued pursuit of mechanical intelligence capable of functioning in a human-like manner has resulted in the advent of true artificial intelligences, they are still subject to a certain amount of suspicion and heavy regulation by those who feel machines should not be permitted to function at this level. Still, some more progressive societies have begun to relax these restrictions, feeling that artificial intelligences are capable of being treated equally to their human counterparts. In these regions, artificial intelligences have become more common amongst their servers and networks, providing additional scientific and culture insight, as well as helping manage industrial tasks. As a consequence, the concept of emancipating AIs is becoming more prevalent and accepted, although there are still many who have concerns about letting artificial intelligences have such freedom.</Text>

The Kalt Geymsla Data Haven was one solution to this problem, an enormous data haven built in Iceland, where the servers could be exposed to the frigid arctic air to keep cooling requirements down, and had local geothermal plants to provide electricity. The facility itself was constructed like an enormous motherboard, with the various components built into the external facade. The waste heat produced by the servers was captured and used to provide heating to the occupied parts of the structure, which contained laboratories, greenhouses, and residences for the staff.

				The concept of a satellite that could collect solar power in orbit, and then transmit it to collectors in the Earth in the form of microwaves, has existed since the mid-20th century. However, it was not made practical until the launch of the Helios Microwave Power Satellite in 2027. Designed to function largely autonomously, with repairs carried out telerobotically, the Helios platform performed without incident until 2046, when the controlling AI on board directed the beam at the Eurasian 23rd Armored Cavalry unit that was besieging a city it was transmitting power to. While the beam was not powerful enough to injure troops in their vehicles, the AI was able to make it intense enough to ignite the dry grassland, causing a raging fire that consumed the division's supplies and forced them to retreat. When interrogated about the attack, the AI defended its actions by stating its protocols required it to protect the communities it was transmitting power to. While initially intended to ensure the microwave beam did no harm to cities, this choice of interpretation was considered a hallmark in the development of AIs capable of making human-level decisions.

				While most early efforts regarding genetic manipulation focused upon the modification and enhancement of existing animal and plant life, there were some ambitious efforts to try and resurrect extinct species of animals and plants. Acquiring preserved DNA was extremely difficult, but utilizing sophisticated computer algorithms and gene splicing to fill in the damaged segments in what few DNA samples could be found allowed researches the monumental feat of resurrecting formerly extinct species. The most notable instance of this effort was "Jurassic Park", where several species of dinosaurs were genetically re-engineered. The effort was a financial success, but the newly created species demonstrated some of the hazards in genetic manipulation -- the new species were poorly understood, and tended to display unexpected behaviors. There were several recorded instances of dinosaurs escaping from captivity, often requiring military intervention to be stopped. These early experiments demonstrated the need for a more comprehensive understanding of how genetically engineered organisms would respond and interact with the environment, and eventually lead to more comprehensive theories of how living organisms and environments interacted as a whole.
