				[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]Tower
				[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]Defense

				[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][COLOR_YIELD_FOOD]Operation:[ENDCOLOR]
				[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]Fixed Unit, can NOT move.
				[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]After finishing building a Citadel Improvement, a Citadel Unit is created on that tile Citadel.
				[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]If you order your worker to change the Citadel Improvement into other kinds of Improvements, its Citadel Unit will be also removed.
				[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]If the city where the Citadel is captured by the enemy, the Citadel Unit suffers -50 HP per turn and -50% [ICON_STRENGTH]Combat Strength due to lack of supply, so it will be destroyed in two turns if you don't retake that city.
				[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]The Citadel units are structures indeed so they can NOT earn Promotions.
				[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]Land-based Aircrafts are allowed to deployed on the Citadel tile with a Firebase or Military Airbase.


				[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][COLOR_POSITIVE_TEXT]Pros:[ENDCOLOR]
				[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]Great Defensive Structure
				[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]No [ICON_RES_MANPOWER] Manpower cost


				[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][COLOR_NEGATIVE_TEXT]Cons:[ENDCOLOR]
				[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]Expensive Maintenance Cost
				[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]Don't think you can be free from invasion only by building servel Citadels. They cannot move so the enemy can easily take a detour.

				[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][COLOR_CYAN]Tactics:[ENDCOLOR]
				[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]Use its sight and firepower to keep an eye on your territory while your troops are on the frontline，especially for areas with important resources or choke points in case of possible enemy harassment.
				[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]It is a relatively cheap way to deploy Land-based Aircrafts outside your cities. Build them on safe areas to allow your aircrafts to extend their flight range.

				[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][COLOR_MAGENTA]Counter Tactics:[ENDCOLOR]
				[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]Like other strategy games, Siege Units have great combat bonus against Citadel Units. One Siege Units can destroy a firebase easily from a long distance.
				[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]It is a waste of time to mess with an enemy's Citadel Unit not in your way. You could simply bypass it and take the enemy's city directly.

				[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][COLOR_CYAN]Tactics:[ENDCOLOR]
				[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]Transfer your first Warrior to a Worker, if there are available resources nearby, to speed up the development of your first city.
				[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]If you are embroiled in an unexpected war, or attacked by barbarians, but you have no or few military units. Transfer your Workers to Militia Units to buy you some time.
				[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]Bring some Militia Units with "Military Reserve" promotion to frontline during an invasion to serve as medical troops. What's more, they are competent cannon fodder to waste enemy's firepower.

				[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][COLOR_MAGENTA]Counter Tactics:[ENDCOLOR]
				[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]They cannot defeat your professional army in a fair fight. If outnumbered, call artillery or air-ground support like in the real life.
				[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]Use Special Forces or Hit-and-run units to deal with them by their great combat bonus or mobility.

				[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]Use its "Shock and Awe" ability to capture enemy unique elite units or experimental units you have missed before.
				[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]Sneak into enemy's territory to sabotage cities, high value units, bridges, strategic resources.
				[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]One experienced Special Forces Unit (with "Blitz" and "Sabotage Cities" Promotion) can capture a small city in the same turn after paradropping. If carefully planned, you can completely destory a nation in one turn.

				[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][COLOR_MAGENTA]Counter Tactics:[ENDCOLOR]
				[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]They cannot defeat your professional army in a fair fight and you won't be outnumbered.
				[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]Use Citadels or Hit-and-run units for overwatch.

				[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]Weak in defending and can be easily outnumbered

				[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][COLOR_CYAN]Tactics:[ENDCOLOR]
				[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]Use them to crush enemy's line. They are unstoppable against almost any other units except Counter Units. Even enemy's unit cannot be killed in one hit, it can also "push" the enemy unit away to break the line or reveal other units under its protection.
				[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]If the enemy's front-line is guarded with Counter Units, try to flank them.
				[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]Pick your target wisely for efficiency. Do not waste their firepower on low value targets like militias.
				[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]Do not run too far, save some MPs to back to safe areas after attacking. They are vulnerable while defending.
				[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]Protect your experienced Heavy Mounted Units or Tanks. They are high value units and can fight much more efficiently than rookies.

				[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][COLOR_POSITIVE_TEXT]Pros:[ENDCOLOR]

				[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]Expensive
				[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]Low price to performance
				[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]Steep learning curve

				[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][COLOR_CYAN]Tactics:[ENDCOLOR]
				[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]Hit-and-run Units are not so "easy to use" for new players. Careful plan and mirco control are required to make full use of these units. You have four different ways to bring them into play.
				[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]1. Scouting: Before attacking enemy's units, send Hit-and-run Units with "Scouting" promotions to move next to the target. This will reduce the target's defense as well as providing flank bonus to make your attack more efficient. In most cases, the first Hit-and-run Units you trained should choose this promotion.
				[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]2. Adding Debuff: If you face strong enemy units, like advanced units, elite units and experimental units, use Hit-and-run Units with "Sunder" promotions to attack them to reduce thier combat strength in defence. The "sunder" effect can be multiplied to -50% combat strength, so you can kill enemy's units even two eras ahead of yours.
				[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]3. Hunt Down: Hit-and-run Units with "Hunt Down" promotions have significant combat bonus against wounded units (even a unit with 99 HP is also considered "wounded"). As a result, they are very powerful to finish up enemy's debuffed or escaping units, especailly those on the other side of a river.
				[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]4. Gank: Besides working as a support unit. A group of 3-5 Hit-and-run Units is able to work alone as a tactical team with high mobility. One unit with "Scouting" promotions provides reconnaissance, while 1-2 unit(s) with"Sunder" promotions softening the enemy and 1-3 unit(s) with "Hunt Down" promotions to finish the enemy up. Such a tactical team can defeat almost all kinds of combination of enemy units in all terrains, without any loss.
				[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]Hit-and-run Units cannot function as your main force due to its low combat strength and high training cost. Make sure they are back to safe areas by the end of your turn. They are vulnerable while defending.
				[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]Protect your experienced Hit-and-run Units. They are high value units and can fight much more efficiently than rookies.
				[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]Remember Hit-and-run Units can perform both melee attacks and ranged attacks. Use melee attacks against enemy's Ranged Units while use ranged attacks for enemy melee units to minimize your casualties.
				[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][COLOR_MAGENTA]Counter Tactics:[ENDCOLOR]
				[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]They are weak while defending and can be easily defeated by your main force units. Beaware that enemy's units with "Hunt Down" promotions also have combat bonus while defending. You should use unit of full HP to attack them.
				[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]With an advantage of shooting range and great combat bonus, Archery Units can easily kill enemy's mounted archers while Anti-air Units can quickly bring down enemy's helicopters. Stack Archery Units or Anti-air Units with Infantry Units or Counter Units to defend your flanks.
				[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]Always keep a neat formation to leave no gaps for enemy's Hit-and-run Units to slip in.

				[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]Low Combat Strength
				[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]Very weak in defending itself
				[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]Must work with escort units

				[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][COLOR_CYAN]Tactics:[ENDCOLOR]
				[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]Archery Units and Anti-air Units are very different from their counterparts in BNW. They are no longer main force units as they shoudl be. They are support units and must work with other units for a better output.
				[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]Units with "Barrage" Promotions can paralyze any enemy's units. Use it to disable strong enemies which cannot be killed in the current turn. This is very helpful if you are outnumbered.
				[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]The perfect defensive formation: stack an Infantry Unit, an Counter Unit, a Citadel Unit or a Militia Unit with a Ranged Unit which has "Fire Support" promotions together during defensive turns. The enemy's Infantry Units, Hit-and-run Units will suffer huge casualties if they dare to attack your position. However, it is useless against Siege Units' bombardment.
				[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]Always work with Hit-and-run Units with "Scouting" promotions to have the best effect.
				[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]Special Forces Units can offer "Target Guide" for this unit to boost its damage.
				[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]Comparing with the Siege Units, Archery Units and Anti-air Units are more fit with defensive missions. However they can still be very useful to eliminate enemy's Counter Units to open a way for your Heavy Mounted Units and Tanks.
				[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][COLOR_MAGENTA]Counter Tactics:[ENDCOLOR]
				[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]They are very weak in melee combat, which means any melee units in the same era can easily kill them in one hit.
				[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]Siege Units have longer shooting ranges and combat bonus against them.
				[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]Anti-air Units have limited firepower against Fighters or Carrier-based Aircrafts. Use "Air Sweep" ability to damage or destroy them to clear a path for your air strike if your land units cannot reach them.
				[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]Although they cannot capture your city, your citizens in the city will be killed by their ranged attacks once the city HP is 0. So get rid of them ASAP!

				[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]In SuperPower Mod, cities have less initial HPs but their HPs regain faster. Cities with a larger population size will have much more HPs. As a result, Siege Unit is vital for attacking a big city.

				[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][COLOR_MAGENTA]Counter Tactics:[ENDCOLOR]
				[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]They are very weak in melee combat, which means any melee units in the same era can easily kill them in one hit.
				[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]They are very slow, so you have plenty of time for counter attack.
				[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]Separate your groups of units to minimize the loss, if enemy's AoE bombardment is unavoidable.
				[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]Although they cannot capture your city, your citizens in the city will be killed by their ranged attacks once the city HP is 0. So get rid of them ASAP!

				[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][COLOR_CYAN]Tactics:[ENDCOLOR]
				[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]If you are building up an navy, but don't know which unit you should choose, build a Naval Melee Unit.
				[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]Naval Melee Units are competent for both aggressive and defensive missions, which makes them the main force (but not the flagships) of your navy.
				[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]Always stay in groups for flanking bonus.
				[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]They can move after attacking and very useful for capturing enemy's coastal cities.
				[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]Early Naval Melee Units are very powerful for a rush strategy since ealy cities are quite vulnerable. Two Trireme can take down an enemy's coastal Capital in two turns in Ancient Era. However, the cost of a Trireme almsot equals an ancient World Wonder.
				[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][COLOR_MAGENTA]Counter Tactics:[ENDCOLOR]
				[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]Naval Ranged Units and Cruisers have great combat bonus against them. In most cases, them can be destroyed in one or two hit by melee attacks.
				[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]Although Naval Hit-and-run units are weak against them, but you can use wolfpack strategy to paralyze them by "Barrage" effects.
				[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]Destroyers have limited firepower against Fighters and Carrier-based Aircrafts. Use "Air Sweep" ability to damage or destroy them to clear a path for your air strike if your land units cannot reach them.

				[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]They are the cheapest regular Naval Units. So build more for reconnaissance and wolfpack strategy. Also don't be afraid of losing one of them.
				[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]They are support units so they cannot serve as the main force. However they can still work in group as a tactical team away of your navy like Land Hit-and-run units. Use them to ambush enemy's flagships or pillage enemy's cargo ships.
				[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]Early Naval Hit-and-run Units can use their ranged attack agaisnt enemy's units in coastal areas or harass enemy coastal cities. While Submarines have longer initial shooting range but lose the ability to attack land units or cities.
				[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][COLOR_MAGENTA]Counter Tactics:[ENDCOLOR]
				[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]Escort your larger navy ships with enough Naval Melee Units. Naval Melee Units can destroy those small vessels in all cases with one hit.
				[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]Always keep a neat formation to leave no gaps for enemy's Naval Hit-and-run Units to slip in. It is very troublesome to have your flagships ambushed during expedition.
				[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]Although Naval Hit-and-run Units cannot capture your cities, they can cause catastrophic result by pillaging all your improvements on water plots and block your coastal cities. Place some naval militia units to guard your coastline.

				[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]Their long firing range can be used to offer fire support for inland forces.
				[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]Pick your target wisely for efficiency. Do not waste their firepower on low value targets like militias.
				[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]Even after the rise of naval aviation, Battleships are still useful to break the deadlock whiel the enemy have strong anti-air powers.
				[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]Battleships are high value units but not dependent on experience. Even rookie Battleship units can cause massive damage to the enemy, which means you don't need to care about your experienced battleships too much.

				[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]if the Aircraft Carrier is destroyed, it will lose all of its Carrier-based Aircrafts on board.
				[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]Carrier-based Aircrafts is allowed to rebase to other Aircraft Carriers but the promotions will NOT be transferred with the aircraft.

				[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][COLOR_CYAN]Tactics:[ENDCOLOR]
				[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]Aircraft Carriers are the symbol of a modern navy. It is a strategic weapon. In the late game, one Super-Carrier is enough to defeat a small nation without enough anti-air forces.
				[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]Newly built Aircraft Carriers are empty. You have to wait for a few turns for its Carrier-based Aircrafts fully loaded. So build them ahead of time!
				[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]Aircraft Carriers must be accompanied by a full carrier battle group to make full use of its power. One single Aircraft Carrier is easy to be outnumbered and destroyed.
				[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]One carrier battle group able for continental warfare can includes 2-4 Aircraft Carriers, 1-3 Battleship(s), 2-5 Cruisers, 8-12 Destroyers, 6-9 Submarines. 1-2 Great Admirals(s).
				[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]Since every Carrier-based Aircraft's attack will transfer its EXP to its carier, Aircraft Carrier will earn new promotions rapidly if engaged in a full fight.
				[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]Needless to say, Aircraft Carriers are the most valued units. Protect your experienced Aircraft Carriers at all cost if you want to win the war.
				[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][COLOR_MAGENTA]Counter Tactics:[ENDCOLOR]
				[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]Submarines have great combat bonus to quickly paralyze them. Aircraft Carriers are not so tough as you may expect. They can be destroyed by 3-4 Submarines in one turn.
				[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]If you have enough anti-air powers, enemy's Aircraft Carriers cannot cause too much damage. Land-based Fighters have higher combat strength, thus they can easily defeat Carrier-based Aircrafts during a dogfight.
				[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]Aircraft Carriers in deep ocean can be nuked without teh fear of nuclear winter.

				[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]Rember to perform an "Air Sweep" everytime before launching an air strike. The intercepting range of Fighters is very long. You will never know how many enemy's Fighters hiding in the fog of war.
				[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]It is always wise to promote your Fighters with "Dogfight" promotion first, since the Fighters' top priority is air supremacy controling. This will also help them to survive from dogfights to have more time for further promotions. 
				[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]Always keep your Fighters upgraded to the most advanced models. Dated Fighters will suffer a crushing defeat fighting against advanced Fighters due to the huge gap of their combat strength and flight range.

				[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][COLOR_MAGENTA]Counter Tactics:[ENDCOLOR]

				[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]Attack Aircrafts also have a deadly effect attacking enemy's naval ships. With enough Attack Aircrafts accompanied by Fighters, you are able to take out the enemy's fleet while your main naval force is out.
				[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]With "Surgical Strike" promotions, Attack Aircrafts can even damage or destroy enemy's units in the city.

				[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]If you want to bring further impact to your enemy's economy, use Strategic Bombers with "Air Siege II" and "Air Siege III" promotions to bomb enemy's main cities to destroy its production buildings adn power plants. This is especially effective if you want to stop your opponent from launching spaceship. However, if you want to capture and make use of the target city, do not do so.

For strategic purposes, it can stop enemy's main cities' production to impact its war capacity and economy. Since it can be intercepted by enemy anti-air units, make sure the sky is clear before launching or strike first at the begining of your invasion.

Named after Chancellor Otto von Bismarck, the primary force behind the unification of Germany in 1871, the ship was laid down at the Blohm Voss shipyard in Hamburg in July 1936 and launched in February 1939. Work was completed in August 1940, when she was commissioned into the German fleet. Bismarck and her sister ship Tirpitz were the largest battleships ever built by Germany, and two of the largest built by any European power.</Text>

			<Text>A kinetic bombardment or a kinetic orbital strike is the hypothetical act of attacking a planetary surface with an inert projectile, where the destructive force comes from the kinetic energy of the projectile impacting at very high velocities. The concept is often encountered in science fiction and originated during the Cold War.The typical depiction of the tactic is of a satellite containing a magazine of tungsten rods and a directional thrust system. When a strike is ordered, the satellite would brake one of the rods out of its orbit and into a geostationary position while directly over the target. The rod would then begin to fall towards the earth, picking up immense speed until it reached terminal velocity shortly before impact. The rods would often be shaped so as to increase the terminal velocity. In science fiction, the tactic is often depicted as being launched from a spaceship, instead of a satellite.

The Crawlers themselves were vulnerable to attack from highly mobile units such as Hovertanks, however, and thus were soon armed with their own defensive missile batteries, capable of using the munitions they manufactured in their own defense.
