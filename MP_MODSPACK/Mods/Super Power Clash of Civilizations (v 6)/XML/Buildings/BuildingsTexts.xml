				The Tower of Babel (/ˈbæbəl/ or /ˈbeɪbəl/; Hebrew: מִגְדַּל בָּבֶל‎, Migdal Bāḇēl) is an etiological myth in the Book of Genesis of the Tanakh (also referred to as the Hebrew Bible or the Old Testament) meant to explain the origin of different languages. According to the story, a united humanity of the generations following the Great Flood, speaking a single language and migrating from the east, came to the land of Shinar (Hebrew: שנער‎). There they agreed to build a city and tower; seeing this, God confounded their speech so that they could no longer understand each other and scattered them around the world.

				The Shoshone are a Native American tribe, who originated in the western Great Basin and spread north and east into Idaho and Wyoming. By 1500 CE some Eastern Shoshone had crossed the Rocky Mountains into the Great Plains. After 1750, warfare and pressure from the Blackfoot, Crow, Lakota, Cheyenne, and Arapaho pushed Eastern Shoshone south and westward. Some of them moved as far south as Texas, to become the Comanche by 1700.

				A sawmill is a facility where logs are cut into lumber (American English) or timber (British English). A sawmill's basic operation is much like those of hundreds of years ago; a log enters on one end and dimensional lumber exits on the other end. In the twentieth century the introduction of electricity and high technology furthered this process, and now most sawmills are massive and expensive facilities in which most aspects of the work is computerized. The cost of a new facility with 2 mmfbm/day capacity is up to CAN$120,000,000. A modern operation will produce between 100 mmfbm and 700 mmfbm annually.

Both installations will be built in Lund. The European Spallation Source, costing some SEK 14 billion to construct, will be operational in 2019 and will give an approximately 30 times stronger neutron beam than any of today's existing neutron source installations. The MAX IV, costing some SEK 3 billion, will be operational in 2015. Both facilities have strong implications on material research.

				The Feitoria - Portuguese for "factory" - were trading posts established in foreign territories during the Middle Ages. A feitoria served simultaneously as marketplace, warehouse, settlement, and staging point for exploration. Often established with a grant from the Portuguese crown, these private enterprises repaid their debt through the buying and selling of goods on behalf of the crown and through collecting taxes on trade that passed through their gates. During the 15th and 16th centuries, a chain of over 50 feitoria were built along the coasts of west and east Africa, India, Malaya, China and Japan. The feitoria allowed Portugal to dominate the Atlantic and Indian Ocean trade routes for three centuries.

Joseph Haydn, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, Ludwig van Beethoven, Franz Schubert and Johann Strauss II, among others, were associated with the city, with Schubert being born in Vienna. During the Baroque period, Slavic and Hungarian folk forms influenced Austrian music.

				A dock (from Dutch dok) is either the area of water between or next to a human-made structure or group of structures involved in the handling of boats or ships, usually on or close to a shore, or the structures themselves. The exact meaning varies among different variants of the English language. "Dock" may also refer to a dockyard or shipyard where the loading, unloading, building, or repairing of ships occurs.

				Shipyards and dockyards are places where ships are repaired and built. These can be yachts, military vessels, cruise liners or other cargo or passenger ships. Dockyards are sometimes more associated with maintenance and basing activities than shipyards, which are sometimes associated more with initial construction. The terms are routinely used interchangeably, in part because the evolution of dockyards and shipyards has often caused them to change or merge roles.

				Tenshu is the central tower or main keep of a Japanese castle. It is the most defining feature of the Japanese castle. Although previous castles usually had a defensible structure for residence and/or administration, the architecturally distinct tenshu was first constructed during the late Sengoku period, or Azuchi–Momoyama period (1573–1603). Azuchi Castle, built in 1576 by Oda Nobunaga, was Japan's first castle to have a tenshu.

Destroyed by a series of earthquakes that struck the region during the 1st millennium AD, portions of the tomb were excavated by British archaeologists in the mid 19th century.

			<Text>Cairo Citadel is a large fortified construction built atop Mokattam hill in Cairo, Egypt. It was constructed under orders of Saladin, Sultan of the Ayyubid Dynasty, between 1176 and 1183 CE, as part of a fortification effort to encircle the cities of Cairo and Fustat with a wall to protect against Crusaders. The citadel was to serve as the main defensive point in the wall. In order to supply the Citadel with water, and provide a source in the event of a siege, Saladin had the Well of Joseph constructed. The well is 85 metres (200 feet) deep, and has three hundred stairs leading to it in a spiral, hense the other name of Spiral Well. Water from this well was transported to the Citadel via a series of Aqueducts. Following the death of Suleiman and during the Mamluk dynasty, Al-Nasir Muhammed took control of the Citadel.

It was constructed during the Great Depression in a competition between two other New York buildings (The Chrysler Building and 40 Wall Street) to be the tallest in New York, America and the World at the time. Each held the title briefly, but the Empire State Building is the tallest, holding the title since 1930, when it was completed. It was surpassed by the construction of the World Trade Center towers, but is now the tallest again following the events of September 11, 2001. Upon construction of the 443 metre tall building, the top was originally hoped to be an Airship terminal for New York City, transporting passengers to the ground via two elevators. This, however, was deemed to risky due to updrafts caused by the size of the building. Along with the Chrysler Building, the Empire State Building is a prime example of Art Deco architecture which was prominent during the Depression years of 1929-1932, and continued into World War 2. [NEWLINE] The Empire State Building is one of the most iconic buildings on earth, and is a landmark of New York City.

It operated from 1919 to 1933. At that time the German term About this Bauhaus - literally "house of construction" - was understood as meaning "School of Building". The Bauhaus was first founded by Walter Gropius in Weimar. The school existed in three German cities: Weimar from 1919 to 1925, Dessau from 1925 to 1932 and Berlin from 1932 to 1933, under three different architect-directors: Walter Gropius from 1919 to 1928, Hannes Meyer from 1928 to 1930 and Ludwig Mies van der Rohe from 1930 until 1933, when the school was closed by its own leadership under pressure from the Nazi regime. The Nazi government claimed that it was a centre of communist intellectualism. Though the school was closed, the staff continued to spread its idealistic precepts as they left Germany and emigrated all over the world.</Text>

				Satellite Units are special late-game units in SuperPower Mod. Those units function as Wonders, which can offer their unique global effects. Some of them can only provide bonus for their launchers while others give bonus to all existing civilizations. They are very helpful to speed up your victory process, especially for a [COLOR_POSITIVE_TEXT]Science Victory[ENDCOLOR]. However you should be aware that some Satellite Units with global effects may also help your opponents to catch up with you.
				[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]You must finish The Apollo program to build Satellite Units. Satellite Units must be built in cities with a spaceship factory.
				[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Satellite Units are like Wonders. They are unique and only one of each kind can exist in the world. If one civilization successfully build out one Satellite Unit, all other civilizations are no longer able to build it.
				[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Satellite Units must be [COLOR_POSITIVE_TEXT]Launched[ENDCOLOR] to be functional. You can launch those Satellite Units simply by moving them to your [ICON_CAPITAL] Capital and press the [COLOR_POSITIVE_TEXT]"Launch Satellite"[ENDCOLOR] button in the unit command panel.
				[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][COLOR_NEGATIVE_TEXT]You CANNOT build Satellite Units if the Science Victory is disabled.[ENDCOLOR]

Armstrong became the first to step onto the lunar surface six hours later on July 21 at 02:56 UTC; Aldrin joined him about 20 minutes later. They spent about two and a quarter hours together outside the spacecraft, and collected 47.5 pounds (21.5 kg) of lunar material for return to Earth. The third member of the mission, Michael Collins, piloted the command spacecraft alone in lunar orbit, until Armstrong and Aldrin returned to it just under a day later for the trip back to Earth.</Text>

			<Text>Weather modding is the act of intentionally manipulating or altering the weather. The most common form of weather modification is cloud seeding to increase rain or snow, usually for the purpose of increasing the local water supply. Weather modification can also have the goal of preventing damaging weather, such as hail or hurricanes, from occurring; or of provoking damaging weather against the enemy, as a tactic of military or economic warfare. Weather modification in warfare has been banned by the United Nations.</Text>
