				In SuperPower Mod, military units and world wonders require a certain amount of [ICON_RES_MANPOWER] Manpower to maintain. If you have abundant [ICON_RES_MANPOWER] Manpower, the [ICON_GOLD] Gold cost for purchasing units and buildings will be reduced due to the lower cost of labor value.

				[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]1. The use of Manpower:
				[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]Building regular army units.
				[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]Building World Wonders.

				[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]2. How to acquire Manpower:
				[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]Cities will provide lots of [ICON_RES_MANPOWER] Manpower, which is its main source. Cities with larger population sizes will provide more [ICON_RES_MANPOWER] Manpower.
				[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]Engineer specialists in your cities will produce a small amount of [ICON_RES_MANPOWER] Manpower. (+2 [ICON_RES_MANPOWER] Manpower per Engineer)
				[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]Some buildings with an icon of [ICON_RES_MANPOWER] Manpower will provide a small amount of Consumer Goods on their own.
				[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]You may also acquire [ICON_RES_MANPOWER] Manpower from other civilizations by trading or allied city-states.

				[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]3. The Global Effects of Manpower:
				[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]If you have abundant [ICON_RES_MANPOWER] Manpower (more than [COLOR_POSITIVE_TEXT]25[ENDCOLOR]), you will receive a discount for the [ICON_GOLD] cost for purchasing units and buildings according to the total number of cities you own (maximum -35%, can multiply with other effects). Here is the math:
				[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]P= n/(c*2)*5 (round down by 5)
				[NEWLINE](P:the discount percentage of [ICON_GOLD] cost for purchasing units and buildings; n:the number of [ICON_RES_MANPOWER] Manpower you currently have; c: the total number of cities you own)

				[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]For example, if you have [COLOR_POSITIVE_TEXT]50[ENDCOLOR] [ICON_RES_MANPOWER] Manpower and own 5 cities. You will receive a bonus of -25% [ICON_GOLD] cost for purchasing units and buildings (P=50/(5*2)*5=25).

				In SuperPower Mod, after entering the Modern Era, the Electricity System will be functional. [ICON_RES_ELECTRICITY] Electricity is a very important resource in the late-game. A modern civilization cannot survive without enough power supply.

				[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]1. The use of Electricity:
				[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]City population size. Larger cities will consume more [ICON_RES_ELECTRICITY] Electricity.
				[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]Almost every post-industrial building requires a certain amount of [ICON_RES_ELECTRICITY] Electricity to be built.

				[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]2. How to acquire Electricity:
				[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]Power Plants buildings (with an icon of [ICON_RES_ELECTRICITY]) is the only source of [ICON_RES_ELECTRICITY] Electricity. Be aware that most of the Power Plants buildings will cause Pollution to the city which slow down the population growth.
				[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]You may also acquire [ICON_RES_ELECTRICITY] Electricity from other civilizations by trading or allied city-states.

				[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]3. The Global Effects of Electricity:

				[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]If the number of [ICON_RES_ELECTRICITY] Electricity is negative (lower than [COLOR_NEGATIVE_TEXT]0[ENDCOLOR]), you will receive [ICON_PRODUCTION] Production and [ICON_RESEARCH] Science penalty by percentage (maximum -50%[ICON_PRODUCTION] Production and [ICON_RESEARCH] Science output nationwide) according to the total number of cities you own. Here is the math:
				[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]P= n*(c/10)
				[NEWLINE](P:the additional percentage of [ICON_PRODUCTION] Production and [ICON_RESEARCH] Science penalty caused by the number of negative [ICON_RES_ELECTRICITY] Electricity; n:the number of negative [ICON_RES_ELECTRICITY] Electricity; c: the total number of cities you own)

				[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]On the contrary, if you have abundant [ICON_RES_ELECTRICITY] Electricity (more than [COLOR_POSITIVE_TEXT]25[ENDCOLOR]), you will receive [ICON_PRODUCTION] Production and [ICON_RESEARCH] Science bonus by percentage (maximum +50%[ICON_PRODUCTION] Production and [ICON_RESEARCH] Science output nationwide) according to the total number of cities you own.

				[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]For example, if you have [COLOR_POSITIVE_TEXT]50[ENDCOLOR] [ICON_RES_ELECTRICITY] Electricity and own 5 cities. You will receive a bonus of +10% [ICON_PRODUCTION] Production and [ICON_RESEARCH] Science output (P=50/5=10). If you have [COLOR_NEGATIVE_TEXT]-50[ENDCOLOR] [ICON_RES_ELECTRICITY] Electricity, you will receive a penalty of -10% [ICON_PRODUCTION] Production and [ICON_RESEARCH] Science output (P=50*(5/10)=25).

			<Text>Electric power is the rate at which electrical energy is transferred by an electric circuit. The SI unit of power is the watt, one joule per second.Electric power is usually produced by electric generators, but can also be supplied by sources such as electric batteries. It is generally supplied to businesses and homes by the electric power industry through an electric power grid. Electric power is usually sold by the kilowatt hour (3.6 MJ) which is the product of power in kilowatts multiplied by running time in hours. Electric utilities measure power using an electricity meter, which keeps a running total of the electric energy delivered to a customer.</Text>

				[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]1. The use of Consumer Goods:

Lapis lazuli takes an excellent polish and was valued for making into jewelry, carvings, vases, and other ornaments; especially in ancient Egypt.
