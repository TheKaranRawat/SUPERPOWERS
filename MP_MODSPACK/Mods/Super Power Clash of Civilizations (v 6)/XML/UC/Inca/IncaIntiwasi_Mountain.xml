				<Text>The Incan unique building Intiwasi replaces the Grand Temple. The City in which is is built will exert religious pressure twice as strongly, increasing the rate at which nearby cities will convert. Additionally, the Intiwasi generates [ICON_GOLD] Gold, especially in cities with mountains. Trade routes other players make to this City will generate an extra 4 [ICON_GOLD] Gold for the City owner and the trade route owner gains an additional 2 [ICON_GOLD] Gold. This combines the effects of the East India Company with the Grand Temple, and will stack with it if built in the same City. The Inca must have a Temple in all cities before they can construct it.</Text>
