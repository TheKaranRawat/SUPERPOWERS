			<Text>The history of Portuguese wine is closely interwined with their relationship with the British. First shipped to England in the 12th century, Portuguese wines would eventually get preferential treatment in the British wine market over French wines, with the fortified wine known as Port receiving increased popularity in Britain. By 1717, Portuguese wines accounted for more than 66% of all wine imported into England, and Port became associated with the "Englishman's drink" with social clubs touting membership of "three-bottle men" or those who were able to drink at least three bottles of Port in one sitting.
