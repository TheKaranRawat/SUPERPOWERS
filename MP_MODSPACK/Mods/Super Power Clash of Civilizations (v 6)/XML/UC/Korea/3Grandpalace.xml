				Changdeokgung ("Prospering Virtue Palace") is one of the "Five Grand Palaces" built by the kings of the Joseon Dynasty. It is set within a large park in Jongno-gu, Seoul, South Korea. As it is located east of Gyeongbok Palace, Changdeokgung is also referred to as the "East Palace".[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Changdeokgung was the most favored palace of many Joseon princes and retained many elements dating from the Three Kingdoms of Korea period that were not incorporated in the more contemporary Gyeongbokgung. One such element is the fact that the buildings of Changdeokgung blend with the natural topography of the site instead of imposing themselves upon it. It, like the other Five Grand Palaces in Seoul, was heavily damaged during the Japanese occupation of Korea.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Changdeokgung was added to the UNESCO World Heritage List in 1997. The UNESCO committee inscribing the site stated the place was an "outstanding example of Far Eastern palace architecture and garden design" being exceptional because the buildings are "integrated into and harmonized with the natural setting" and adapted "to the topography and retaining indigenous tree cover."
