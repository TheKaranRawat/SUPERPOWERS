			<Text>A riad is a traditional Moroccan house with an interior garden or courtyard. The riads were inward focused, which allowed for family privacy and protection from the weather in Morocco. In the central garden of traditional riads there are often four orange or lemon trees and possibly a fountain. The walls of the riads are usually adorned with Arabic calligraphy with quotes from the Quran.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The style of these riads has changed over the years, but the basic form is still used in designs today. Recently there has been a surge in interest in this form of house after a new vogue of renovation in towns such as Marrakech and Essaouira where many of these often-crumbling buildings have been restored to their former glory. Many riads are now used as hotels or restaurants.</Text>
