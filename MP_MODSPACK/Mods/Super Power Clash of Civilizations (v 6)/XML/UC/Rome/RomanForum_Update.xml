				<Text>The Forum is a Roman unique building that increases the amount of [ICON_GOLD] Gold a city generates. Trade routes other players make to a city with a Forum will generate an extra 1 [ICON_GOLD] Gold for the city owner and the trade route owner gains an additional 1 [ICON_GOLD] Gold for the trade route. Unlike the Market it replaces, the Forum also increases a city's [ICON_GREAT_PEOPLE] Great Person generation by 25%.</Text>
