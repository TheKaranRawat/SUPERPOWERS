			<Text>The Viking house, sometimes called a Viking Longhouse, was the center of life in the Viking Age. Not only was the home the place where people found warmth, food, and shelter, it was also where they came to relax with board games and music. It was also the place to come and listen to the poets tell stories of the gods and the heroes from the past.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Life in the home was based around a long central hearth which would have rarely been put out. If the fire was put out it would have been relit by striking flint against steel. There would have been multiple families living in these Viking Longhouses. The closer your family was to the central hearth, the higher your rank was in the household.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Vikings in Scandinavia built primarily of wood, although stone and peat was used in some areas, especially in Norway. The Viking homes on Iceland, Greenland and the Faeroe Islands were made primarily of stone and peat.</Text>
