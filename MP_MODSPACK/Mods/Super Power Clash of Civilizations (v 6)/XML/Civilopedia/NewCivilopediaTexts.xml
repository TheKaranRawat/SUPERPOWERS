			<Text>Infantry is the most basic forces in your land military. They are strong, versatile, but cheap and slow. Their main task is defending the front-line.

After earning “Cover“ Promotion and going fortified, they are very strong vs ranged attacks. [NEWLINE]2, They have combat bonus attacking cities. Use them to capture enemy cities to reduce unnecessary loss. [NEWLINE]3, they are very cheap to build or purchase, stick together and use their numbers to overwhelm strong enemies. [NEWLINE]4, Gunpowder Infantry can perform a ranged attack before charging, making them strong at attacking. [NEWLINE]5, Accompanied with enough counter and ranged units, they can build up an almost unbreakable frontline. [NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Counter Tactics: [NEWLINE]1,Siege weapons with “volley” Promotion can easily destroy fortified infantry units. [NEWLINE]2, Use heavy mobile units (knights and tanks) have combat bonus vs infantry units, so they can charge at enemy infantry and “kick” them back and break their battle line, [NEWLINE]3, Use your fast-attack units or naval ranged units to sunder them, then they are easier to kill.</Text>

			<Text>Mobiles Units are fast and powerful professional assaulting units.  They are designed to break through the enemy frontline. Starting with combat bonus for attacking and ability to move after attacking, they can easily make holes in the enemy lines and then ride straight through them. [NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Advantages: [NEWLINE]Strong when attacking[NEWLINE]Excellent balance between mobility and combat strength[NEWLINE]Can force the enemy to withdraw[NEWLINE]May deal critical damage to stacked enemy units[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Disadvantages:[NEWLINE]Expensive and require certain resources[NEWLINE]Weak vs Counter Units which are much cheaper[NEWLINE] Weak when defending itself and can be easily outnumbered[NEWLINE]Weak attacking cities or be attacked by cities[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Tactics: [NEWLINE]1, When it inflicts more damage to the enemy than it receives, forces the enemy unit to withdraw and deal damage to other units in the target tile. As a result, it can seriously damage or destroy enemy high-value target by driving away the protector. [NEWLINE]2, Use its mobility wisely, after charging, shift to safe position to evade from enemy counter-attacks. [NEWLINE]3,After earning pillage-related promotion, it can pillage enemy improvements without spending MP. Use it to enhance survivability or do harm to enemy’s economy. [NEWLINE]4,If the enemy’s anti-tank firepower is strong, try to give your tanks “Armored Plating” Promotion to improve their survivability.[ [NEWLINE]5, NEVER use it to attack the countering units. It’s certain death. Try to use your ranged units to destroy them before charging or simply take a detour.[NEWLINE]5, Protect your experienced mobile elites, they are much more useful than recruits. [NEWLINE][NEWLINE] Counter Tactics: [NEWLINE]1, Certain counter units are designed to fight with them, build pikemen and anti-tank guns to defend your frontline. Counter units can kill the attacking mobile opponent of the same era instantly when defending. [NEWLINE]2, The siege weapons can only do very limited damage to them. Don’t waste your ammo on them.  [NEWLINE]3, All anti-tank units can perform a ranged attack to allow them to destroy enemy tanks in a safe distance. However, if the enemy tanks have”Armored Plating”, the ranged attack will be less-effective, and then you should consider melee attacks. [NEWLINE]4, If your enemy have lots of advanced mobile units, don’t get panic, try to use fast-attack units or naval ranged units to sunder them. Since they don’t have any defensive bonus, they will be very weak when sundered. </Text>

			<Text>Mounted Archery Units are professional hit-and-run units designed for fast-attack missions in pre-industrial eras.  [NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Advantages: [NEWLINE]Can perform both ranged and melee attacks[NEWLINE]Excellent mobility and can move after attacking[NEWLINE]Can sunder the enemy[NEWLINE]have bonus vs wounded units (needs the “hunt down” promotion) [NEWLINE] Good survivability [NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Disadvantages:[NEWLINE]Poor price to performance [NEWLINE]Both melee and range combat strength are weaker compared with certain melee and ranged units of its era [NEWLINE]Cannot pillage[NEWLINE]Weak attacking cities or be attacked by cities[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Tactics: [NEWLINE]1, Their cost indicates they are not designed for mass-production. Their task is not to charge into enemy lines but to “gank”.[NEWLINE]2, They can work with heavy mounted units nicely. Use their “sunder” ability to sunder the enemy to soften their defense and then let your knight crush them.[NEWLINE]3, They can also work in small groups away from your main force. You need at least two mounted archers, one promoted with "sunder" and the other, “hunt down”. Use the “sunder” unit to wound the enemy and soften its defense, then let the “hunt down” unit deal damage, since the bonus can be as high as 100%, nobody can stands several turns of such attack, even the enemy is an unit of advanced era.[NEWLINE]4, Don’t forget they can still melee! Use its melee attack against enemy ranged units, especially the weak but dangerous siege weapons. Sometimes you need to deal a certain amount of damage to sunder the enemy, because their melee combat strength is higher than range. [NEWLINE]5, For the same reason, they are capable for defensive tasks, use them to cover your ranged units if needed. Note that the bonus vs wounded units is also effective while defending. [NEWLINE]6, Protect your experienced elites, they are much more useful than recruits. After earning the “logistics”, one unit can use its ranged attack to sunder the enemy then use the anti-wounded bonus to serious damage or even kill the enemy. [NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Counter Tactics: [NEWLINE]1, Their range combat strength is not as strong as the archery units of the same era.  Use your archers to shoot them from a safe distance and can deal critical damage to them. If with “barrage” promotion, archers can easily slow them down. [NEWLINE]2, The siege weapons can only do very limited damage to them(they belong to mounted units). Don’t waste your ammo on them.  [NEWLINE]3, For the same reason, use units with anti-mounted ability to attack them to deal fatal damage. [NEWLINE]4, If the enemy MOunted Archery Unit has the “hunt down” promotion, don’t use wounded units to attack them. As mentioned above, it is still effective when defending! [NEWLINE]5, In higher difficulty levels, the rich AI will build lots of them to trouble you. AI will only use its melee attacks but that is bad enough. So always make your troops stay in neat formation followed by reserve force – if AI uses them to sunder your frontline units, you can quickly draw them back and fill the position with reserve force. </Text>

[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Advantages: [NEWLINE]Can perform both ranged and melee attacks[NEWLINE]Excellent mobility with a hovering ability: can move across mountains and enter costal area, also can move after attacking[NEWLINE]Can sunder the enemy[NEWLINE]have bonus vs wounded units (needs the “hunt down” promotion) [NEWLINE]Good survivability [NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Disadvantages:[NEWLINE]Poor price to performance [NEWLINE]Both melee and range combat strength are weaker compared with certain melee and ranged units of its era [NEWLINE]Cannot pillage[NEWLINE]Cannot capture cities[NEWLINE]Weak to attack aircrafts and ground anti-air fire [NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Tactics: [NEWLINE]1, Since they also belong to fast-attack units, so all tactics of Mounted Archery Units are also suitable for them. [NEWLINE]2, However, their hovering movement distinguishes them from those Mounted Archery Units, so take the advantage of it. They are capable to across the mountain or river to launch a surprise attack and then withdraw unharmed. [NEWLINE]3, Unlike the original Civ 5 games, helicopters don’t start with anti-tank bonus, if you need them to attack enemy tanks you need to promote them with “ambush”. However this is less efficient. The best way to defeat enemy tanks is to use helicopters to sunder them and use your anti-tank weapons destroy them quickly and safely.[NEWLINE]4, Clear the sky before send your helicopters to the frontline unless you want them to be cookies of enemy’s attack aircrafts. Also avoid any enemy anti-air units get too close to your helicopters. [NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Counter Tactics: [NEWLINE]1, Land anti-air units - AA guns , mobile Sams and attack aircrafts are the natural enemies of helicopters. They can bring the enemy helicopter of the same era down only by one hit.  Land anti-air units have great bonus when defending attack from helicopters, so you can also use them to cover your troops from enemy helicopters assault. [NEWLINE]2, The siege weapons can only do very limited damage to them (they are floating in the air). Don’t waste your ammo on them.  [NEWLINE]3, Modern Archery Units (machine guns, bazookas, ATGM vehicles) can deal “acceptable” damage to helicopters since they have a better range combat strength and can slow them down with the “barrage” promotion. [NEWLINE]4, If the enemy helicopter has the “hunt down” promotion, don’t use wounded units to attack them. It is still effective when defending! [NEWLINE]5, In higher difficulty levels, the rich AI will build lots of them to trouble you. AI will only use its melee attacks but that is bad enough. So always make your troops stay in neat formation followed by reserve force. Keep an eye on your siege weapons and heavy artilleries, AI helicopters love rushing to them from the fog of war! </Text>

Use them to defend important positions instead of charging into the enemy frontline. [NEWLINE]2, However, they can still be deadly when attacking their countering units if promoted with certain promotions. Use them to destroy the enemy knights or tanks who have pushed too far from their frontline. [NEWLINE]3, Anti-tank units and anti-air units can perform ranged attacks. Use them wisely to avoid unnecessary damage. [NEWLINE]4, Use infantry units or mobile units to cover them from enemy ranged attacks. [NEWLINE]5, Land anti-air units won’t take damage during enemy fighters’ air-sweep. So use them to waste enemy fighters’ air-sweeps. [NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Counter Tactics: [NEWLINE]1, they are usually slower than their countering units. Why not take a detour other than directly run into them?  [NEWLINE]2, The archery units, siege weapons, heavy artilleries can deal fatal damage to them. Use them to wipe them out to clear the path.  [NEWLINE]3,  Land anti-air units’ firepower cannot stop strategic bombers.  If you cannot clear them out, you can still order your strategic bombers to attack enemy cities. They may take damage but can hardly get shot down.</Text>

[NEWLINE]Can pin down the enemy [NEWLINE]Can counter-attack enemy ranged attacks [NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Disadvantages:[NEWLINE]Limited mobility [NEWLINE]Weak range combat strength, especially attacking enemy units with anti-ranged-attack promotions [NEWLINE]Very weak if caught in melee combat [NEWLINE]Cannot capture cities unless the city has only 1 population. [NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Tactics: [NEWLINE]1, They are fire-support units, not frontline units. They must always be covered by melee units. [NEWLINE]2, After earned the “barrage” promotion, they can pin down the enemy units to stop them from advancing or escaping. However, you are still recommended to earn “accuracy” first since you must have enough firepower to trigger the pinned down effect.[NEWLINE]3, Gating guns and machine guns are very effective to take down enemy infantry units but weak attacking tanks. This will change after upgrading to bazookas; they will no longer have bonus vs infantry but vs tanks. [NEWLINE]4, The archery units and counter units will join hands in the last from. The last archery unit shown up in the game is the ATGM vehicle. As a result, you may consider cultivate some elite counter units with the “blitz” promotion, after upgrading to the ATGM vehicle, the “blitz” promotion can multiply with “logistics” promotion which will make it can shoot up to three times per turn![NEWLINE]5,After earning “logistics” promotion, it can attack twice per turn but the combat strength is reduced by 25%. So choose it wisely. [NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Counter Tactics: [NEWLINE]1, they can counter-attack ranged attacks but they are very weak in melee combat. Use your mobile units to crush them other than use ranged unit to shoot. [NEWLINE]2, Siege weapons have a longer shooting range and higher range combat strength, so they can cause considerable damage to them free from being fought back.  [NEWLINE]3,  Although the “barrage” promotion doesn’t always function well for human players’ units, AI units use it quite disgustedly. So don’t rush too far if the AI has many archery units or your units may never come back. </Text>

This is very effective especially when you don’t gain the air-superiority.

They can heal your naval units even out of friendly territory. [NEWLINE]2, Aircrafts stationed on the carrier can also be healed quickly. [NEWLINE]3, The aircrafts on their decks are more valuable than themselves. Never go out alone, stay within your fleet. [NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Counter Tactics: [NEWLINE]1, Use submarines to sneak into the enemy fleet and destroy the carrier. However, Super-carriers are very strong. Nothing can kill it with one hit unless nuclear missiles. [NEWLINE]2, If you have enough anti-air firepower, you don’t need to worry too much about them. </Text>

If you attack the unit with the wrong promotion, say, use a naval attack aircraft to attack the infantry, the damage inflicted is very limited. [NEWLINE]2, For most cases, you should have more anti-land attack aircrafts than anti-naval or anti-armor ones since there are other more professional units to do the job. (Submarines and anti-tank units)[NEWLINE]3, Make sure the target tile is clear first. Always use your fighters for air-sweeps before attacking. If intercepted by any kinds of anti-air firepower of the same era, they can seldom come back alive. [NEWLINE]4, they can also take down enemy helicopters with ease. [NEWLINE]5, Remember: WWI bomber is a tactical bomber and upgrades to dive bomber, not bomber as the original Civ5 game.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Counter Tactics: [NEWLINE]1, Air-superiority fighters and anti-air units are lethal to them. Make sure you can control the sky. [NEWLINE]2, If you are fallen behind in technology, for instance, AI has WWI aircrafts but you don’t have any anti-air weapons, retreat your troops from their land into your cities nearby, AI will turns to aimlessly attack your cities. Then use a great scientist to discover the certain tech - you should always have a great scientist stored for emergency research. </Text>

			<Text>Strategic Bombers are long range heavy bomber units designed for attacking enemy cities to damage the enemy’s economy. As a strategic weapon, they are useful for the military deterrence. [NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Advantages: [NEWLINE]Can cause massive damage to the enemy’s economy by destroying building and killing population in the cities [NEWLINE]Very long air-range [NEWLINE]Cannot be stopped by the enemy land anti-air units [NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Disadvantages: [NEWLINE]Extremely expensive and require lots of resources [NEWLINE]Weak attacking units[NEWLINE]Weak to intercepting fighters [NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Tactics: [NEWLINE]1, If the target city doesn’t have a bomb shelter, it will suffer fatal destruction only after a few  bombardment missions. As a result, your bombers force them build expensive bomb shelters in all large cities – which also proves to be a kind of damage to their economy. [NEWLINE]2, Their most useful promotion could be “air siege I” which can destroy the enemy city’s defensive building to make your ground troops take it easily. [NEWLINE]3, If you want to capture the enemy city and make use of it, you’d better not promote them with “air siege II” and “air siege III” or you are destroying your own buildings! [NEWLINE]4, their blockbuster bombs are not designed for attacking units, don’t waste their bombs. [NEWLINE]5, They are always the most expensive units of its era. Always perform an air-sweep before attacking; otherwise, it will damage your economy! [NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Counter Tactics: [NEWLINE]1, Only the air-superiority fighters of the same era can stop them from bombing the city. Land or naval anti-air units cannot stop them, as well as the old version air-superiority fighters. [NEWLINE]2, Build bomb shelters in all of your major cities. Although bomb shelters’ maintenance cost is very expensive, it is better than getting bombed back to the Stone Age. Don’t think your cities far away from the frontline are safe - strategic bombers’ air range are able to reach you from another continent. [NEWLINE]3, They can only do little damage to the population the city with a bomb shelter. However they can still destroy the certain buildings. </Text>

(If not so, AI will use them to suicide which makes the thing worse) [NEWLINE]2, They have a very long air-range for interception. However you still need land anti-air units to cover the gap. [NEWLINE]3, If you are going offensive, you should have more fighters with “dogfight” promotion to take down enemy fighters. They are still able to intercept after performing an air-sweep. Else, defensive, you may consider “sortie” promotion. [NEWLINE]4, Always upgrade your fighters to the latest model. Fighter can be easily shot down if attacked by advanced enemy fighters and can hardly stop advanced enemy strategic bombers.

[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Nuclear winter (also known as atomic winter) is a hypothetical climatic effect of countervalue nuclear war.

			<Text>Cause: Nuclear detonations will spread fallout over tiles on the map. After 0.5% of the tiles of the whole map are covered by fallout, the nuclear winter event will be triggered. [NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Effect: There are four stages in the nuclear winter. It will get to the next stage if more nuclear weapons are launched. [NEWLINE][NEWLINE]1, Nuclear Winter Warning - The proportion of Fallout tiles: 0.5%- 1%. You will receive a warning if more nuclear weapons are detonated. [NEWLINE]2, Nuclear Winter Strikes - The proportion of Fallout tiles: 1%- 5%. All tiles with Food Output larger than 3 will reduce by 1 for every new nuclear detonation, until it reaches 3. This will slow down the population growth in all cities. [NEWLINE]3, Nuclear Winter Deteriorates - The proportion of Fallout tiles: 5%- 10%. All tiles with Food Output will reduce by 1 for every new nuclear detonation, until it reaches 1. This will leads to global famine. [NEWLINE]4, Nuclear Winter Apocalypse - The proportion of Fallout tiles > 10%. All tiles' Food and Production output will reduce to 0 with new nuclear detonations. All survivors will starve to death.

			<Text> Unfortunately, the nuclear winter is an irreversible process. Once happened, the climate can never be restored. However, there is still ways to prevent it. [NEWLINE][NEWLINE]1, One nuclear explosion cannot cause the nuclear winter, only a global nuclear war can be strong enough to make it happen. Since the event is triggered by calculating the total number of fallout tiles of the map, many nuclear detonations within a limited area (kinds of nuclear tests) won’t cause the nuclear winter. [NEWLINE]2, You can slow down the nuclear winter process by scrubbing out the fallout tiles. This will stop it from entering to the next stage but cannot restore it to its previous condition. [NEWLINE]3, The best way to prevent the nuclear winter is to stop the nuclear warfare - the Nuclear Non-Proliferation is very important. [NEWLINE]4, If the nuclear winter gets to its worst condition, it will be the end of the human civilizations. However, you still have a little chance to win: waiting for a cultural or diplomatic, or even time victory and it should be less than 10 years. </Text>

			<Text>In Super Power Mod, there are something new about the City States and you need to pay attention.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]1. City States can produce their own strategic resources. [NEWLINE]Each City State has 4 [ICON_RES_HORSE] Horses, 4 [ICON_RES_IRON] Iron, 4 [ICON_RES_COAL] Coal, 4 [ICON_RES_OIL] Oil and 4 [ICON_RES_ALUMINUM] Aluminum of their own, even they donot have those resources in their land. As a result, you are allowed to give them units with resource requirement and needless to worry about they will suffer from resource penalty. Your City State allies will also provide those strategic resources for you once you have researched the certain Technologies. Therefore, you are free from lacking of strategic resources if you have many allied City States. It will be very helpful for small nations. [NEWLINE][NEWLINE]2. Money is less effective for buying out City States. [NEWLINE]Money can't buy real friends. The Gold gifts are very ineffective in Super Power Mod. Instead, completing missions from City States will greatly improve your relationships with them. If you really want to maintain good relationships with City States, you are highly recommended to adopt the Patronage policy tree. [NEWLINE][NEWLINE]3. Your units as a gift will spend only 1 turn to travel to the City State. [NEWLINE]You can give units to City States more often. This is a very important way to maintain your relationships with them and help them to defend their lands. [NEWLINE][NEWLINE]4. City States have bonus on city-defense. [NEWLINE]Each City State has a 50% bonus on their city defense to defend them from barbarian or aggressive nations in the early game. However they are still weak when invaded by strong nations. You should depoly troops to protect your allied City States or give them units as gifts.</Text>
